# Reproducibility

To guarantee the reproducibility of our models, we rely on virtual environments and VCS tools.

## Environments
We use [Poetry](https://github.com/poetry/poetry) to validate the constraints generated by the dependencies of our model, and lock the versions that were used to generate a model, in a `poetry.lock` file.

This file can be reused to reinstall a previous environment by running
```bash
poetry install
```
